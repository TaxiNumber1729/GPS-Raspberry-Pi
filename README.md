# GPS-Raspberry-Pi
Global Positioning System (GPS) project from Raspberry Pi using Navit *(https://www.navit-project.org/)* . 

# **(What is Navit?)**
>Navit is a car navigation system with routing engine. Navit's modular design is capable of using vector maps of various formats for routing and rendering on the screen. It's even possible to use multiple maps at the same time. The GTK+ or SDL user interfaces are designed to work well with touch screen displays. Points of Interest of various formats are displayed on the map. The current vehicle position is either read from gpsd or directly from NMEA GPS sensors. The routing engine not only calculates an optimal route to your destination, but also generates directions and even speaks to you using espeak. Navit currently speaks 49 languages, can run on various platforms (Linux, Windows, Android, OpenMoko Freerunner, Wince, Nokia n800 Internet tables, iPhone, Zaurus..)

# **(Who is it meant for?)**
This project is meant to help the rare few who are not in possession of a GPS. I know some GPS systems are expensive to afford so using the Raspberry Pi to run Navit for car navigation is a good alternative.
