# GPS-Raspberry-Pi
Global Positioning System (GPS) project from Raspberry Pi using Navit *(https://www.navit-project.org/)* . 

# **(What is Navit?)**
>Navit is a car navigation system with routing engine. Navit's modular design is capable of using vector maps of various formats for routing and rendering on the screen. It's even possible to use multiple maps at the same time. The GTK+ or SDL user interfaces are designed to work well with touch screen displays. Points of Interest of various formats are displayed on the map. The current vehicle position is either read from gpsd or directly from NMEA GPS sensors. The routing engine not only calculates an optimal route to your destination, but also generates directions and even speaks to you using espeak. Navit currently speaks 49 languages, can run on various platforms (Linux, Windows, Android, OpenMoko Freerunner, Wince, Nokia n800 Internet tables, iPhone, Zaurus..)

# **(Why?)**
This project was originally created with no intentions of entering in competitions, but a sudden change of mind made me decide to enter it into Raspberry Pi contests. The project was originally meant as a way for me to experiment with hands-on learning outside of the classroom. As I spend more time on the project, It slowly evolved into something more tangible. Thus, it led me to think of entering it into competitions just for the joy of competition.
